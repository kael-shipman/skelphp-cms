  "description" : "The Skel CMS is intended to be a highly-customizable, bare-bones CMS based on content types that each extend the basic Content class. Websites will typically use the Page class, which adds a URI, image, title, meta tags, and other such things to the basic Content class, but other classes are certainly possible. For example, one might build a Video class that stores information about youtube or vimeo videos. The advantage of this is that each custom content type is a class that can have its own built-in functionality.",
